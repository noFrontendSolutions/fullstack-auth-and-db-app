# fullstack-auth-and-db-app

---

This project is an fullstack exercise, which was given to me in a course I've participated in. The task was to create a blogging page for multiple users, which enables the user to login and create an article or blog-entry, which then shows up on the index page of the app and gets stored on a database.

I've used **Next.js** to build the application. For the authentication part, I've used **auth0**, **MongoDB Atlas** to store the data, and for the styles I've used **Tailwind CSS**, like always. As a special feature, the blogs/articles can be written in **markdown**. 

I'm temporarly using the app to promote my github projects in order to make it a bit more appealing to the eyes. Nevertheless, feel free to play around with it. You can delete your contributions afterwards and leave no traces. I'm not storing your user data in a separate DB collection. Here is a link to the apps:
